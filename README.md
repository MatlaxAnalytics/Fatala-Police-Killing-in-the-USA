# Fatala-Police-Killing-in-the-USA
Overview:
This project involves the use of Power BI to create an interactive visualization of fatal police killings of civilians in the USA. The data used in this project is obtained from a public dataset and includes information such as the age, gender, race, location, and cause of death of the civilians.

Requirements:
To run this project, you will need to have Power BI Desktop installed on your computer. The dataset used in this project is publicly available and can be downloaded from the following link: https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings

Installation:
To install Power BI Desktop, you can download it from the official Microsoft website: https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/

Data:
The dataset used in this project should be saved in a CSV file format and saved in a directory within the project folder. The file name should be provided in the code where the data is being read.

Project Structure:

The main Power BI file is named 'fatal_police_killings_in_the_US.pbix'.
The project folder also includes a 'data' folder where the dataset is saved.
Execution:
To run the project, open the 'fatal_police_killings_in_the_US.pbix' file in Power BI Desktop. The data will automatically be loaded into the report. You can then use the various visualizations and filters to interact with the data.

Functionality:
The 'fatal_police_killings_in_the_US.pbix' file contains the following visualizations:

Map: Shows the location of fatal police killings on a map of the USA.
Bar chart: Shows the number of fatal police killings by race.
Stacked column chart: Shows the number of fatal police killings by gender and race.
Donut chart: Shows the percentage of fatal police killings by cause of death.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how to use Power BI to create an interactive visualization of fatal police killings of civilians in the USA. It can be further extended to include more advanced visualizations and analyses such as time series analysis, predictive modeling, and text analysis of news articles related to the topic.
